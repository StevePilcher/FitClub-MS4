# Testing

The testing of the FitClub site was conducted manually. This tesing document references the [User Stories](https://github.com/StevePilcher/FitClub-MS4/blob/master/media/files/FitClub_User_Stories.pdf) file. The unique story ID will be referenced when a specific user story is tested/verified. 

The testing is broken down firstly, seperated to different user types, then per app and finally page if the app has multiple pages/actions to test to that. Comments on screen size testing will be made to show validation for smaller form factors. 

The followng scenarios were tested :

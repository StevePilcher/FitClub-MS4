# Testing

The testing of the FitClub site was conducted manually. This tesing document references the [User Stories](https://github.com/StevePilcher/FitClub-MS4/blob/master/media/files/FitClub_User_Stories.pdf) file. The unique story ID will be referenced when a specific user story is tested/verified. 

The testing is broken down firstly, seperated to different user types, then per app and finally page if the app has multiple pages/actions to test to that. Comments on screen size testing will be made to show validation for smaller form factors. 

The followng scenarios were tested :

## Anonymous User (AU)

### Home App

1. Landing Page:
    1. Got to home page
    2. Layout displays correctly on desktop
        2a. 




1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
